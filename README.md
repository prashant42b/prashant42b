<h2>Who Am I? ðŸ¤” </h2>
Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with a knack for turning coffee into code. I graduated from SRM Institute of Science and Technology with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering in 2022. I kicked off my career at TCS, where I dabbled in everything from jQuery to Java-Spring. I even had a brief foray into business process management with the PMO Office. And that journey lasted from July 2022 to May 2024. But then it was time to move on. To a life filled with exciting learnings, lessons and new experiences.

</p>

<h2>My Toolkit ðŸ”­</h2>
Languages: Python, Java, GoLang, SQL, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS<br><br>

<h2>Fun Fact âš¡</h2>
I didn't dive into Git/GitHub until January 2024, and boy, has it been a ride! It's like discovering a whole new dimension of coding â€“ who knew version control could be so exciting?
